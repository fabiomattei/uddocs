Designing web applications is a repetitive process. We need to create forms to gather data and tables and reports to give back data. They all are similar, not exactly the same but not that much different. I spent so much time developing project management applications tailored to needs of different organization. This is the solution I found more productive: to create a templating system that cover the 90% of interfaces and logics I am designing and to use a normal MVC framework for the remaining 10%.

If you are interested about my library I recommend to start from this descriptive page and then read this <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/crud">tutorial</a>.
