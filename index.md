Designing web applications is a repetitive process. We need to create forms in order to gather data and tables and reports in order to give back data. All forms, all tables are similar, not exactly the same but not that much different. I spent so much time developing project management applications tailored to needs of different organization. 

This is the solution I found more productive: to create a templating system that cover the 90% of interfaces and logics I am designing and to use a normal MVC framework for the remaining 10%.
