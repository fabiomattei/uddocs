Designing web applications is a repetitive process. We need to create forms to gether data, tables and reports the give back data. I spent the most of my life developing project management applications tailored to needs of different organization. The solution I found more productive was to create a templating system the covered the 90% of the interfaces I was designing in my day to day job and using a normal MVC framework for the remaining 10%.
