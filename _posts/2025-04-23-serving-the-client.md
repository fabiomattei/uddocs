There is a danger that us, as software engineers, always run: **forget about the client**.

We like to play with new toys learn sophisticated way to solve new problem, to learn new languages and 
to try new things all the time. 

**This is so dangerous!**

We tend to forget that we need to deliver value to our client, we need to solve his problems, we need to
find the best way to serve him. 

We should repeat to our-self all the time: how am I helping my client?.

Don't get me wrong: we need to learn every day to improve our skills and to become more productive.
We need to be careful anyway to never lose sight of the purpose of our work: deliver features and simplify
our clients life.
