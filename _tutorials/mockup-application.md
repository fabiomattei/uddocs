## The very start

Sometimes we deal with users that have very little understanting of their needs and of the problems they need to solve. We need the ability
to sketch an application without spending too much time because the design we make is very likely to change.

UD allows us to quickly design an application without the need of creating a datamodel bases only on interfaces.
