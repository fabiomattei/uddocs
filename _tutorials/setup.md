# Setup of the system

UD has been designed in order to take advantage of docker so setting it up is relatively easy.

If you just donwload the master folder from the <a href="https://github.com/fabiomattei/uglyduckling">project repository</a> and you type:

{% highlight shell %}
docker-compose up -d
{% endhighlight %}
