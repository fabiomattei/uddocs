# Is it possible to structure a working web application using only json files?

The short answer is: yes, for the most part.

When I started with this idea of structuring the different pages of a web application using just json files i tought I could only do that for the simplest pages, the ones with a simple UI and a simple logic behind them. 

Going ahead with the work I was making page after page, controllers started to become slimmer and slimmer, models where starting to shrink. It was really mindo blowing.

I must be honest you cannot just model an entire application using only json files.
