This class gives the structure to create an HTML block. A Block is a subsection of a HTML page. It could be a form, a table or a list. 
It is not ment to be a basic HTML tag but a section of a page big enough to be visible from the user as a unity of content.

Any HTML structure can be formalised as a block.
