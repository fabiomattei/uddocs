## Basic idea

A filter is a structure that allows the developer to filter and modify an output of a database query, or a get parameter of a value o any type of source in order to to some change before to show it to the user.

In order to implement a filter it is needed to define a function having the same name. That function is going to be called when the filter is activated.
